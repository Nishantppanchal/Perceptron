# Perceptron

This perceptron is neuron that is able to detect the difference between Xs and Os. Although it can be trained to believe and X or O is whatever shape the user desires by retraining it. The pre-existing trained perceptron is not prefect, however it simply a proof of concept and provided me a valuable learning experience.

Libraries used:
* Pyglet (for the GUI)

[See it in action on Replit](https://replit.com/@NishantP13/Perceptron?lite=true)

Note the laggy expirence is due to very limited computing power on replit, not the program itself.
