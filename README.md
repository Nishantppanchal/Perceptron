# Perceptron
This perceptron is neuron that is able to detect the difference between Xs and Os. Although it can be trained to believe and X or O is whatever shape the user desires by retraining it. The pre-existing trained perceptron is not prefect, however it simply a proof of concept and provided me a valuable learning experience.
